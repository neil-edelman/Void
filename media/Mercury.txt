Global Coverage

Date: 22 Feb 2013

The view shown here is similar to an earlier one, posted in October
2011, but now the coverage is more complete. The globe on the left
was created from the MDIS monochrome surface morphology base map
campaign. The globe on the right was produced from the MDIS color
base map campaign. Each map is composed of thousands of images, and
the color view was created by using 3 of the 8 color filters acquired.
(1000, 750, and 430 nm wavelengths are displayed in red, green and
blue, respectively.)
