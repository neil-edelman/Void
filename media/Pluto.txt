Global Mosaic of Pluto in True Color

Pluto

Four images from New Horizons’ Long Range Reconnaissance Imager
(LORRI) were combined with color data from the Ralph instrument to
create this sharper global view of Pluto. (The lower right edge of
Pluto in this view currently lacks high-resolution color coverage.)
The images, taken when the spacecraft was 280,000 miles (450,000
kilometers) away from Pluto, show features as small as 1.4 miles
(2.2 kilometers). That’s twice the resolution of the single-image
view captured on July 13 and revealed at the approximate time of
New Horizons’ July 14 closest approach.
