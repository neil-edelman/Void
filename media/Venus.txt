Original Caption Released with Image:

The northern hemisphere is displayed in this global view of the
surface of Venus. The north pole is at the center of the image,
with 0 degrees, 90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270 degrees east longitudes
at the 6, 3, 12, 9 o'clock positions, respectively, of an imaginary
clock face. Magellan synthetic aperture radar mosaics from the first
cycle of Magellan mapping are mapped onto a computer-simulated globe
to create this image. Data gaps are filled with Pioneer Venus Orbiter
data, or a constant mid-range value. Simulated color is used to
enhance small-scale structure. The simulated hues are based on color
images recorded by the Soviet Venera 13 and 14 spacecraft. The image
was produced at the JPL Multimission Image Processing Laboratory
and is a single frame from a video released at the October 29, 1991,
JPL news conference.
