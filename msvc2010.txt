Stuff to to to make it work in MSVC2010
---------------------------------------

You'll have to manually build the stuff in tools before you can compile. See Makefile.

http://glew.sourceforge.net/ build <glew>\build\vc10\glew.sln Release (the MX is multi-thread)

http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/ build VisualStudio/2010/freeglut.sln Static Release
make sure to turn off "Whole Program Optimization," as it will not work at all

File, New, Project, Visual C++, Win32 Console Application
Application Settings, Empty
Change Debug to Release
Remove all files (should be no files?)
Drag all files to the project in the Solution Explorer
Right click the project, Properties, Configuration: Release

Configuration Properties->General->Target Name: Void

Configuration Properties->General->Whole Program Optimisation: Use Link Time Code Generation

Configuration Properties->VC++ Directories->Include Directories: add <glew>\include and <glut>\include

Configuration Properties->C/C++->General->Warning Level: EnableAllWarnings (/Wall)

Configuration Properties->C/C++->Preprocessor->Preprocessor Definitions: add GLEW, USE_MATH_DEFINES, and C89_FMINF

Configuration Properties->C/C++->Enable C++ Exceptions: No

Configuration Properties->C/C++->Floating Point Model: Fast (fp:fast)

Configuration Properties->C/C++->Advanced->Compile As: Compile as C Code (/TC)

Configuration Properties->Linker->General->Version: 3.1

Configuration Properties->Linker->Input->Additional Dependancies: uncheck Inherit from parent, <glew>\lib\Release\Win32\glew32s.lib;<glut>\lib\x86\freeglut_static.lib

Configuration Properties->Linker->Input->Ignore Specific Default Libraries: LIBCMT
(oh, now it wants it, well, never mind)

Configuration Properties->Linker->Debugging->Generate Debug Info: No

Configuration Properties->Linker->System->SubSystem: Console (/SUBSYSTEM:CONSOLE)

-----------------------------------
With MSVC2013, I have not successfully done this.
