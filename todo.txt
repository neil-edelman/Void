Words for Things
----------------
<gang>, band, pack, horde, herd
<kind>, character, ethos
specimen, sample, instance, occurrence, manifestation, embodiment, epitome, representative, aitype -- have different ais, of course; also, ai(align) -- specimen: aitype, alignment, ship*
<zone>, sector, region

Bug List
--------

Gate travel is wonky again.

Random (only in Jupiter) sprites expanding? check current_tex

Features
--------

relies on 1997 technology

Have sprite lists for asteroid breakup.

circle bounding -> multiple circle (AI could decide?) gartner1999fast esa99_final

more rotational acceleration/friction

allow data types to be used as keys (ie, weak entity)

add supporting resource for array resources, eg, (maybe opt it so it searches for repeat "strings")
.type
Foo
string name
Bar bars[]
.lore
Foo
foo
[
bar1
bar2
]
Bar
bar1
Bar
bar2
.c
struct Foo {
	char *name;
	unsigned bars_size;
	struct Bar *bars_first;
};
static struct Bar foo_bars[2] = { &bar[0], &bar[1]; };
static struct Foo foo[] = { { "foo", 2, &foo_bars[0] } }
.c
struct Foo {
	char *name;
	size_t bars_no; struct Bar *bars[];
}
static struct Foo foo = { "foo", 2, { &bar[0], &bar[1] } };

landing (have landing spot (x,y))
space elevator landing spots: Kampala, Uganda (just south, Lake Victoria), Singapore, Malaysia (just south)

Random.c; P[\mu_x,\mu_y,\sigma] = f(x|\mu,\sigma) = \frac{1}{\sigma\sqrt{2\pi}}e^{-\frac{(x-\mu)^2}{2\sigma^2}} Gaussian distribution in space to find ships. Also, custom dist based on objects of interest

instead of having all asteroids on zone at a time, have only when the player is there; otherwise have a random field

things that you can buy that allow different things to be picked up, eg gold mining sieve

look up how to get outlines (I think you just add a little bit to the size and then render it in one colour)

text engine (display lists? wrapping?) -- communication

select icon, target display (ships, planets, stations, links)

fog & astroids different distances (using FFT compression?) fill in space between planets and foreground and space after planets

build up asteroids from smaller chunks; hit them and calculate new chunks with procedural generation; the same for ships! when you break apart, goodies fall out

missions

max wattage (increased with add-ons) 65GW(start) 317GW(all full of the important) 453GW(2 bars) 824GW(almost full)

Mercury is too blurry near the edges; remnants of other Mercury remain (turn off save tx px?)
